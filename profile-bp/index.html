  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) 2.2 defines a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model">data model</a> for expressing policies which requires classes and concepts
    for its assertions. A basic set of classes and concepts is defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#vocab-core">ODRL Core Vocabulary</a> and the data model permits users of ODRL to define their own subclasses and concepts for a specific use.</p>
  <p>Specific sets of classes and concepts are named as ODRL Profile and a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile">full chapter</a> of
    the data model recommendation covers its purpose, required conformance
    and a mechanism for creating new ones.</p>
  <p>This document walks users through the ODRL Profile chapter, explains
    how to implement a Profile and provides some examples.Â  A user planning
    to create an ODRL Profile should start with reading the section about
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-motivation">purpose
    of an ODRL Profile</a>.</p>

  <h2>What an ODRL Profile can define</h2>
  <p>This sections walks through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-mechanism">ODRL
    Profile Mechanism</a> of the ODRL Data Model. All items below, except the last one, are about adding an ODRL-related specification. Such a specification does not become part of the ODRL 2.2 Recommendation but an ODRL Processor processing ODRL Policies with a specific Profile must be able to understand this Profile's specification.</p>
  <p>The seqence of additional specifications follows priorities of use expected by the ODRL Community Group.</p>
  <h3>Additional Actions for Rules</h3>
  <p>An instance of ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-Action">Action </a>is used as value of the mandatory property <code>action </code>of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule</a> class, and all its subclasses Permission, Prohibition and Duty (and ones defined by a Profile).The
    Recommendation defines only two instances of Action: <code>use</code>, covering any
    use of an asset while the ownership of the asset does not change, and <code>transfer</code>,
    covering the transfer of the ownership of an asset in perpetuity.</p>
  <p>If these two core Actions are sufficient a Profile does not need to add
    more. But in most cases additional Action instances are required and the example
    shows how to add two to the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>digitize </code>is an Action already <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-digitize">defined </a>by the ODRL Common Vocabulary. But this Common Vocabulary is not
      part of the ODRL Recommendation, therefore Actions defined by it must
      be adopted by the Example Profile 1. <br>
      Note: an Action defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary does not have to be included into the specification of a Profile, its is only required to express that it is included into the Profile. Find more about that in 
    Resources defining an ODRL Profile.</li>
    <li><code>changecolours </code>is an Action defined for and by this
      Example Profile 1</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 1 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exaction1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">odrl:digitize

  rdfs:label "Change Colours"@en ;
  :includedIn odrl:use ;
  skos:definition "For using a graphics asset its colours are changed."@en .</pre>
  </div> 
  <h3>Additional Constraint Left Operands</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-class">Constraint </a>is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of its
    mandatory properties is <code>leftOperand</code> and instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-LeftOperand">Left
    Operand</a> are used as values of this property, the Recommendation does not define any instances.</p>
  <p>If any Constraint will be used for a Policy using a specific Profile at
    least one Left Operand must be defined for the mandatory leftOperand
    property. The example shows how to define two for the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>elapsedTime </code>is a LeftOperand already <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-elapsedTime">defined </a>by the ODRL Common Vocabulary. But this Common Vocabulary is not
      part of the ODRL Recommendation, therefore LeftOperands defined by it
      must be adopted by the Example Profile 1<br>
      Note: a LeftOperand defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary does not have to be included into the specification of a Profile, its is only required to express that it is included into the Profile. Find more about that in 
    Resources defining an ODRL Profile.    </li>
    <li><code>aggregatedTime </code>is a LeftOperand defined by the Example
      Profile 1</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 2 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exleftop1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">odrl:elapsedTime

  rdfs:isDefinedBy odrl: ;
  rdfs:label "Elapsed Time"@en ;
  skos:definition "A continuous elapsed time period which may be used for exercising of the action of the Rule. Right operand value MUST be an xsd:duration as defined by [[xmlschema11-2]]."@en ;
  skos:note "Only the eq, lt, lteq operators SHOULD be used. See also Metered Time. Example: <code>elpasedTime eq P60M</code> indicates a total elapsed time of 60 Minutes." ;
  skos:scopeNote "Non-Normative"@en .

exns1:aggregatedTime
  a :LeftOperand, owl:NamedIndividual, skos:Concept ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1: ;
  rdfs:label "Aggregated Time"@en ;
  skos:definition "A aggregation of elapsed time periods which may be used for exercising of the action of the Rule. Right operand value MUST be an xsd:duration as defined by [[xmlschema11-2]]."@en ;
  skos:note "Only the eq, lt, lteq operators SHOULD be used. See also Metered Time. Example: <code>aggregatedTime eq P800M</code> indicates aggregated elapsed time of 800 Minutes." .</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Constraint Operators</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-class">Constraint </a>is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of its
  mandatory properties is <code>operator</code> and instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-Operator">Operator</a> are used as values of this property, the Recommendation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#constraintRelationalOperators">defines</a> 12 instances.</p>
  <p>The example show how to define an Operator instance for Example Profile 1</p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 3 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exconstropor1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">exns1:doubleof
	a :Operator, owl:NamedIndividual, skos:Concept ;
	rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1: ;
	skos:definition "Indicating that a given value is the double of the right operand of the Constraint."@en ;
	rdfs:label "Double of"@en .</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Party Functions</h3>
  <p>An instance of ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#partyRoles">Party
    Function</a> is used as value of the property <code>function </code>of the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule</a> class, the Recommendation defines 14 instances. <code>function</code> sets the
    relationship between a subclass of a Rule (Permission, Prohibition,
    Duty, ...) and a Party or a PartyCollection.</p>
  <p>The example shows how to define the Party Function <code> toBeNotifiedParty </code>for the Example Profile 1, a party which
    must be notified in the context of executing the action of a Rule. </p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 4 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="expartyfunctrole1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">exns1:toBeNotifiedParty
  a rdf:Property , owl:ObjectProperty, skos:Concept ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1: ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :function ;
  rdfs:label "To Be Notified Party"@en ;
  skos:definition "The Party which must be notified."@en;
  skos:note "May be specified as part an action requiring the notification of a Party."@en .</pre>
  </div>
    
  <h3>Additional Asset Relationships</h3>
  <p>An ODRL Asset Relationship is a relationship between a subclass of a
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule</a> (Permission, Prohibition, Duty, ...) and an Asset, the Recommendation <a

          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-relation">defines </a>only <code> target </code>and <code>output </code>as sub-properties of <code>relation</code>.</p>
  <p>The example shows how to define the asset relationship <code>input </code>for
    the Example Profile 1, an asset required as input for the action of a
    Rule.</p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 5 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exrelsubpro1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">exns1:input
  a rdf:Property , owl:ObjectProperty, skos:Concept ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1: ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :relation ;
  rdfs:label "Input"@en ;
  skos:definition "The input property specifies the Asset which is used as input of the Action."@en ;
  rdfs:domain :Rule ;
  rdfs:range :Asset.</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Constraint Right Operands</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-class">Constraint </a>is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of its
    mandatory properties is <code>rightOperand</code> (or its alternative <code>rightOperandReference</code>)
    and instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-RightOperand">RightOperand </a>are used as value of this property, the Recommendation does not define any. </p>
  <p>If any Constraint will be used for a Policy using a specific Profile it
    may be required to define one or more RightsOperands. The example shows
    how to define one for the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>policyUsage </code>is a RightOperand already <a href="%C2%B4https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-policyUsage">defined </a>by the ODRL Common Vocabulary. But this Common Vocabulary is not
      part of the ODRL Recommendation, therefore RightOperands defined by it
      must be adopted by the Example Profile 1.<br>
      Note: a Right Operand defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary does not have to be included into the specification of a Profile, its is only required to express that it is included into the Profile. Find more about that in 
    Resources defining an ODRL Profile.    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 6 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exrightop1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">odrl:policyUsage
  a :RightOperand, owl:NamedIndividual, skos:Concept ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy odrl: ;
  rdfs:label "Policy Rule Usage"@en ;
  skos:definition "Indicates the actual datetime the action of the Rule was exercised."@en ;
  skos:note "This can be used to express constraints with a LeftOperand relative to the time the rule is exercised. Operators indicate before (lt, lteq), during (eq) or after (gt, gteq) the usage of the rule. Example: 'event lt policyUsage' expresses that the identified event must have happened before the action of the rule is exercised."@en ;
  skos:scopeNote "Non-Normative"@en .</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Logical Constraints operands</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-logical">Logical
    Constraint</a> is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of
    its properties must be a sub-property of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-operand">operand
    property</a>, the Recommendation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#constraintLogicalOperands">defines
    four</a> of them: or, xone, and, andSequence.</p>
  <p>For a Logical Constraint with another operand sub-property a new one
    must be defined by a specific Profile. The example shows how to define
    one for the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 7 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exlogconstrop1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">exns1:xtwo
  a rdf:Property , owl:ObjectProperty, skos:Concept ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1: ;
  rdfs:subPropertyOf :operand ;
  skos:definition "The relation is satisfied when only two, and not less or more, of the Constaints is satisfied"@en ;
  rdfs:label "Exactly Two"@en ;
  skos:note "This property MUST only be used for Logical Constraints."@en .
</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Policy Conflict Strategy Preferences</h3>
  <p>An instance of ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-ConflictTerm">Conflict
    Strategy Preference</a> is used as value of the property <code>conflict </code>of
    the Policy class, the Recommendation defines three instances: perm,
    prohibit and invalid.Â  </p>
  <p>The example shows how to define the Conflict Strategy Preference <code>ignore </code>for the Example Profile 1 (may not be of real help ...). </p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 8 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exconflstragpref1" class="hljs">exns1:ignore
  a :ConflictTerm, owl:NamedIndividual, skos:Concept;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1: ;
  rdfs:label "Ignore Conflicts"@en ;
  skos:definition "Ignore conflicts."@en ;
  skos:note "Used to determine policy conflict outcomes."@en .</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Rule Subclasses</h3>
  <p>The ODRL Data Model Recommendation defines the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule
    Class</a> and three subclasses of it: the Permission Class, the
    Prohibition Class and the Duty Class. The ODRL Profile Mechanism permits
    to create additional subclasses; their definitions must comply with the
    design of the basic Rule Class:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have one <code>action</code> property value of type Action.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none or one <code><em>relation</em></code> sub-property values of type Asset.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one or
      many <code><em>function</em></code> sub-property values of type
      Party.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one or
      many <code><em>failure</em></code> sub-property values of type Rule.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one or
      many <code>constraint</code> property values of type
      Constraint/LogicalConstraint.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none or one <code>uid</code> property values (of type IRI [<cite><a class="bibref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#bib-rfc3987">rfc3987</a></cite>])
      to identify the Rule so it <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> be referenced by other Rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A new Rule subclass must be defined as disjoint with all other Rule
    subclasses.</p>
  <p>Defining a subclass of Rule allows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by the Rule class as &quot;MAY have none or one&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by the Rule class as &quot;MAY have none, one or many&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST have many&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>One or more additional properties may be defined. For a property its name (identifier), its occurrance and its value type must be defined.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The example shows how to define of a subclass <code>StraightPermission1 </code>for the  Example Profile 1</p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 9 (TTL)</span></div>
    <pre id="exrulesubcl1" class="hljs" aria-busy="false" aria-live="polite">exns1:StraightPermission1
  a rdfs:Class , owl:Class, skos:Concept ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy expf1:
  rdfs:subClassOf :Rule ;
  owl:disjointWith :Permission, :Prohibition, :Duty ;
  rdfs:label "Straight Permission 1"@en ;
  skos:definition "A Rule permitting the use of an Asset"@en ;
  skos:note "A Straight Permission 1 Rule must not contain any property for expressing a duty."@en .</pre>
  </div>
  <h3>Additional Policy Subclasses</h3>
  <p>The ODRL Data Model Recommendation defines the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy">Policy
    Class</a> and three subclasses of it: the Set Class, the Offer Class
    and the Agreement Class. The ODRL Profile Mechanism permits to create
    additional subclasses; their definitions must comply with the design of the
    basic Policy Class:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Policy <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [<cite><a class="bibref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#bib-rfc3987">rfc3987</a></cite>])
      to identify the Policy. <br />
      A subclass must adopt this rule.</li>
    <li>A Policy <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have at least
      one <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>, or <code>obligation</code> property values of type Rule.<br />
      A subclass can combine any set of one <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>,
      or <code>obligation</code> property values as long as this basic rule
      is satisfied.<br />
      Examples:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Only <code>permission </code>property values</li>
      <li>Only <code>permission </code>property values, five as maximum</li>
      <li>Only <code>permission </code>or <code>prohibition </code>property
        values</li>
      <li>Only at least 1 <code>permission </code>and at least 1Â  <code>prohibition </code>property value</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A Policy <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one,
      or many <code>profile</code> property values.<br />
      This is an implicitly met requirement: if a Profile is defined it must
      be expressed by a <code>profile </code>property values to become
      effective.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A new Policy subclass must be defined as disjoint with all other Policy
    subclasses, except the Set subclass.</p>
  <p>Defining a subclass of Policy allows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by the Policy class as &quot;MAY have none or one&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by the Policy class as &quot;MAY have none, one or many&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST have many&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>If the Policy class defines &quot;<em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have at least
    one&quot; with a list of properties to select from a restricted set of properties and/or a specific combination of properties can be defined. (See the examples for <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>, or <code>obligation</code> property values above.)</li>
    <li>One or more additional properties may be defined. For a property its name (identifier), its occurrance and its value type must be defined.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The example shows a basic definition of a subclass <code>SpecialOffer1 </code>for the

    <h3>How to use multiple Profiles in a single Policy</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy">Policy</a> class defines for the <code>profile</code> property that none, one or many profile identifiers can be applied. This raises the question: what should be considered if more than one Profile is applied to an instance of a Policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First it should be considered that applying only one profile identifier to the <code>profile</code> property means that two profiles are in use: the default <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-core">ODRL Core Profile</a> and this other profile.</li>
      <li>Subclasses, sub-properties or instances of a class included into a Profile are defined in either a specific namespace  or in the ODRL namespace if this thing is defined already by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#vocab-common">ODRL Common Vocabulary</a>.</li>
      <li>Subclasses, sub-properties or instances of a class defined in a namespace used for e.g. Example Profil 1 can also be adopted for another Profile, e.g. Example Profile 2. (Note: be aware that the identifier of a Profile and the identifer of a namespace used by it does not have to the same.)</li>
      <li>If a subclasses, sub-properties or instances of a class is defined in a namespace with an identifier different from the identifier of the Profile this thing can be used by multiple Profiles (with identifiers different from the namespace) but they MUST be defined by each Profile in exactly the same way. E.g. a Rule subclass exns1:StraightPermission defined by Example Profile 1 as not having any property expressing a Duty must not have in a definition of Example Profile 2 a property expressing a Duty.<br>
        Note: for this purpose this Best Practices document uses the term &quot;adopt&quot; for including the definition of a thing which may be included by other Profiles. In particular this term was used for things defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary is a use of things defined by it by other Profiles has to be expected.
      </li>
      <li>For using a thing defined by Example Profile 1 by a Policy using Example Profile 2 it is not strictly required to adopt this thing of Example Profile 1 for Example Profile 2, formally it is sufficient to apply the identifiers for Example Profile 2 and of Example Profile 1 to the <code>profile</code> property of the Policy.</li>
      <li>If multiple identifiers of Profiles are applied to the <code>profile</code> property of the Policy all the things defined by all of them are valid for this Policy. If only subsets of the things defined by multiple Profiles should be applied to a Policy a new Profile should be created adopting only the things of this subset.</li>
      <li>If Party A defines a Profile with things defined by (and in a namespace of) Party B the adoption must comply with the copyright of these things.</li>
